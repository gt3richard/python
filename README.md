### Python Reference Guide

A series of python examples to reference python usage

`interview_refresher`
Use for a quick refresher on the most useful commands right before an interview.
I also suggest doing a quick 10 minute meditation or breathing exercise
to calm you nerves.

`hello_world`
Simple class / function program pattern to use for any interview 
if a runtime environment isn't provided.

`builtInFunctions`
Deeper dive into built in helper functions included with Python

`builtInTypes`
Deeper dive into most used types and basic operations you can perform

`/simple_problems`
Collection of solutions to simple problems I've solved

`/advanced_problems`
Collection of more complex problems for reference. But really the only
way to remember these is to keep writing them from scratch over and over
until you memorize how to identify and solve these problems.
